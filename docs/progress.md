# Progress

## Toolchain gate — 2026-09-27

`vp install`, `vp check`, `vp test`, `vp build` and `vp pack` all pass on the empty scaffold.

### Scaffold notes

- Created with `vp create vite:monorepo`, `vp create vite:library` (×2) and `vp create vite -- web --template react-ts`. `--directory` only works with built-in templates; `create-vite` takes the name as a positional and `vp create` places it under `apps/` itself.
- The `vite:library` template in rc.1 writes `pack.dts: { tsgo: true }`, which fails type-checking against tsdown 0.23 (`dts.tsgo` is now an options object, and tsgo is picked automatically for TypeScript 7). Replaced with `dts: true`.
- `defaultPackage` in the root `vite.config.ts` only applies to bare commands. `vp dev --port 5173` bypasses it and serves the workspace root (404); use `vp dev` or `vp -C apps/web dev --port …`.
- The root must declare `@types/node` from the catalog. Without it the root resolves the latest `@types/node` and pnpm installs a second peer variant of `vite-plus`.
- The app's lint block moved to `lint.overrides` in the root config, and its `vite.config.ts` imports `defineConfig` from `vite-plus`.

## Parser and editor — 2026-09-27

- Every fixture (7.33–7.38, base game and all DLCs) round-trips its decompressed body byte for byte, including the 451 MB body of the largest save.
- The 40 MB save parses in about 2.4 s in Node and loads in about 6 s in Chrome. Saving it takes about 7 s with the native `CompressionStream` versus 28 s with `fflate`.
- Checked by hand in Chrome: edit → download → reload for duplicants, critters (clone, tame), materials, research, game settings, asteroids and raw edits; undo and redo after each.
- A production build served from `/oni-duplicity/` loads saves and portraits. Lazy-loading the pages cut the main chunk from 688 kB to 399 kB (122 kB gzipped).
- Nothing is verified in the game yet.

## Geyser edits follow the rolls — 2026-11-05

- The decompiled `GeyserInstanceConfiguration` recomputes `scaled*` from the rolls whenever a save is loaded (`didInit` is not saved), so the first version of the geyser editor, which changed only `scaled*`, would most likely have been undone by the game.
- Edits now set the roll and write the matching value, clamped to the type's range. The ranges are transcribed into `packages/game-data/src/geyser-types.ts`; every game-rolled geyser in the ten fixtures matches them exactly.
- Four geysers in the owner's colony sit at their type maximums regardless of their rolls, most likely from a mod. The editor flags them.
- Next: in-game check of a geyser edit; e2e tests.
- Risk: the decompile's game build is unknown. If a build keeps the saved values instead, the edits still hold, since both are written.

## Review fixes for the save editor — 2026-11-05

- A bulk edit that fails partway is now rolled back before the error surfaces, so a half-applied change can no longer reach a download without an undo entry. The undo snapshot already covered everything the bulk actions touch (duplicant behaviour data and extra data).
- Undoing a debug-flag edit no longer adds a `debugWasUsed` key to a save that lacked one.
- The map refuses a world whose offset or size falls outside the saved grid, and the map page shows the reason.
- New tests cover the rollback, the debug flag, each bulk action (write, parse, compare which paths changed) and the map on every fixture.

## End-to-end tests — 2026-11-05

- Playwright suite in `apps/web/e2e/`: each test loads a fixture, edits through the UI, downloads the save and re-parses it with the save-parser. `expectOnlyChanged` then asserts that the diff against the original is exactly the intended paths and nothing else.
- `diffSaves` also compares `templates`, and for arrays of different lengths it reports each added or removed index (`path/<i>`) next to `path/length`, so a test expecting a length change has to account for the items.
- Coverage (45 tests):
  - colony rename, sandbox and debug flag;
  - undo/redo and the unsaved-changes list;
  - duplicant name, gender, interests, experience, appearance, traits, skills, attributes, amounts and effects (add, remove, cycles), and pasting part of a profile;
  - every colony-wide action: relieve stress, fill needs, master skills, set every attribute;
  - bionic power bank and gear oil;
  - critter tame, wild, clone and delete;
  - geyser value, clamp and rename;
  - materials mass, temperature and bulk edits;
  - research, one tech and everything;
  - asteroid rename and discover;
  - a difficulty setting;
  - raw edit, plus array remove and duplicate.
- The suite runs in about 65 s locally (45 passed, twice in a row).
- CI runs it in the `ci` job after the build.
- Risks:
  - The bionic test needs the 40 MB full-tier fixture, so it is skipped on PRs and runs only on full-tier CI (`main` and nightly). There it fails instead of skipping when the fixture is missing (`CI` set and `FIXTURE_TIER=all`).
  - Deleting a critter left no reference in the decoded data of `beautiful-galaxy`: no decoded value refers to any critter id, whereas duplicant ids are referenced 5,244 times. Undecoded raw bytes were not checked, so confirm in game.
- Next: parser acceptance (bench, fuzz, differential).

## Load/save polish — 2026-11-05

- Autosave: saves whose header says `isAutoSave` get an "Autosave" badge in the header and a note that the game's autosave rotation may overwrite an edited autosave. The note names `gameInfo.originalSaveName` (a field of `SaveGame.GameInfo` in the decompile, present in the fixtures) and `Summary` now carries it. The download name is unchanged.
- Load errors: a friendly title (not an ONI save, unsupported version, truncated or corrupted, or unknown) picked from the parser's message, plus a collapsible "Details" section with the message, byte offset and stack, and a copy button. Errors cross the worker as plain `Error`s, so the offset is read back from the message.
- "Download save" now opens a confirm dialog: distinct changed targets ("3 duplicants, 1 geyser, colony settings"), the edit labels, and a "Back up your original save first" warning. Each history entry in the worker carries a category and key (`editTarget` in `describe.ts`). The post-download toast no longer repeats the backup advice.
- The tab title starts with "• " while there are unsaved edits.
- Tests: unit tests for the grouping and error classification, and e2e for the dialog (cancel, confirm), grouping, the title, autosave, a truncated file and a non-save file. No fixture is an autosave, so the autosave e2e rewrites the header of `beautiful-galaxy` and loads that.
- Risk: the "not an ONI save" versus "truncated" split is a heuristic on the parser's message, since the worker boundary drops `ParseError`'s fields.
